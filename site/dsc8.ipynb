        "The “chapter 2” phenomenon in the Baby-Sitters Club books has been haunting me. Ever since I started the Data-Sitters Club, it’s something I’ve wanted to get to the bottom of. It’s trotted out so often as an easy criticism of the series -- or a point of parody (as we’ve done on our own “[Chapter 2](chapter-2/)” page that describes each of the Data-Sitters and what the club is about), and it feels particularly tractable using computational text analysis methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the uninitiated, the Baby-Sitters Club books are infamous for the highly formulaic way that most of the books’ second chapters (or occasionally third) are structured. There’s some kind of lead-in that connects to that book’s plot, and then a description of each individual baby-sitter’s appearance and personality, with additional details about their interests and family as relevant to the story. It’s part of how the series maintains its modularity on a book-by-book basis, even as there are some larger plot lines that develop over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "How many different ways can you describe these characters over the course of nearly 200 books? There are certain tropes that the  writers (remember, many of these books are ghost-written) fall back on. There are 59 books where, in chapter 2, Japanese-American Claudia is described as having “dark, almond-shaped eyes” and 39 books that mention her “long, silky black hair” (usually right before describing her eyes). 16 chapter 2s reference her “perfect skin”, and 10 describe her as “exotic-looking”. 22 chapter 2s describe Kristy as a “tomboy” who “loves sports”. 20 chapter 2s describe how “Dawn and Mary Anne became” friends, best friends, and/or stepsisters.\n",
        "\n",
        "So it’s not that this critique of the Baby-Sitters Club series is *wrong*. But what I wanted to do was quantify *how right* the critique was. And whether there were any other patterns I could uncover. Do the chapter 2s get more repetitive over the course of the series? Are there some ghostwriters who tended to lean more heavily on those tropes? Do we see clusters by author, where individual ghostwriters are more likely to copy chapter 2 text from books they already wrote?\n",

        "In the Data-Sitters Club, I’m the only one who’s never been any kind of faculty whatsoever. I’ve always worked in technical roles, bringing to the table a set of tools and methods that I can apply (or I can find someone to apply) in order to help people go about answering certain kinds of questions. Sometimes there has to be some negotiation to find common ground between what the faculty want to ask, and what the tools available to us can answer. Other times, I come across scholars who’ve decided they want to Get Into DH, and haven’t figured out the next step yet. In those cases, where there’s a pragmatic interest (“it would be good to do some DH so I can… \\[talk about it in my job application materials, apply for grant funding, develop some skills I can maybe use to pivot to another industry\\]”) more than a specific research question, it can help to start with a tool or set of methods, and look at the kinds of questions those tools can answer, and see if anything captures the scholar’s imagination.\n",

Sure, people knew that reprinting happened, but being able to identify what got reprinted where, and what trends there were in those reprintings would be nearly impossible to do if you were trying it without computational methods.\n",

        "[Viral Texts](https://viraltexts.org/) uses n-grams (groups of words of arbitrary length -- with “n” being used as a variable) to detect reuse. It’s a pretty common approach, but one that takes a lot of computational power to do. (Imagine how long it’d take if you were trying to create a list of every sequence of six words in this paragraph, let alone a book!) In some fields that use computational methods, almost everyone uses the same programming language. Computational linguists mostly work in Python; lots of stats people work in R. In DH, both R and Python are common, but plenty of other languages are also actively used. [AntConc](https://datasittersclub.github.io/site/dsc4/) is written in Perl, [Voyant](https://datasittersclub.github.io/site/dsc6/) is written in Java, and Palladio (a [mapping/visualization software developed at Stanford](http://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/)) is written in Javascript. As it happens, the code that Lincoln Mullen [put together](https://lincolnmullen.com/software/textreuse/) for detecting n-grams is written in R. The Python vs. R vs. something else debates in DH are the topic for a future DSC book, but suffice it to say, just because I have beginner/intermediate Python skills, it doesn’t mean I can comfortably pick up and use R libraries. Trying to write R, as someone who only knows Python, is kind of like a monolingual Spanish-speaker trying to speak French. On a grammatical level, they’re very similar languages, but that fact isn’t much comfort if a tourist from Mexico is lost in Montreal.\n",

Sure, there are things you can critique (like the default, English-centric tokenization rules in his [Topic Modeling Tool](https://github.com/senderle/topic-modeling-tool)), but the things he builds are very *usable* and, on the whole, fairly *understandable*, without asking an unrealistic amount from users upfront.

        "Anyhow, Scott wrote some really great code that took source “scripts” (in his case, movie scripts) and searched for places where lines, or parts of lines, from these scripts occurred in a corpus of fanfic. Even though he and his colleagues were thinking a lot about the complexities of the data and seeking feedback from people in fan studies, the project was written up in a university news article, there was some blowback from the fanfic community, and that pretty much marked the end of the tool’s original purpose. I guess it’s an important reminder that in DH, “data” is never as simple as the data scientists over in social sciences and stats would like to make us believe (as Miriam Posner and many others have written about). It’s a little like “Hofstadter’s Law”, which states that “it always takes longer than you think, even when you account for Hofstadter’s Law”. Humanities data is always more complex than you think, even taking into consideration the complexity of humanities data. Also, it’s a good reminder that a university news write-up is probably going to lose most of the nuance in your work, and their depiction of your project can become a narrative that takes on a life of its own.\n",

Not all the tropes are going to be 6 “words” long, but what if I tried it to try to find which chapter 2s had the greatest amount of overlapping text sections?\n",
        "\n",
        "Scott was kind enough to sit down with me over Zoom a couple months into the pandemic to go through his code, and sort out how it might work when applied to a set of texts different from the use case that his code was written for. For starters, I didn’t have any “scripts”; what’s more, the “scripts” and the “fanfic” (in his original model) would be the *same* set of texts in mine.\n",

        "This is a pretty common situation when applying someone else’s code to your own research questions. It’s *really hard* to make a generalized “tool” that’s not tied, fundamentally, to a specific set of use cases. Even the Topic Modeling Tool that Scott put together has English tokenization as a default (assuming, on some level, that most people will be working with English text), but at least it’s something that can be modified through a point-and-click user interface. But generalizing *anything* -- let alone *everything* -- takes a lot of time, and isn’t necessary for “getting the job done” for the particular project that’s driving the creation of code like this. Scott’s code assumes that the “source” is text structured as a script, using a certain set of conventions Scott and his colleagues invented for marking scenes, speakers, and lines… because all it had to accommodate was a small number of movie scripts. It assumes that those scripts are being compared to fanfic -- and it even includes functions for downloading and cleaning fanfic from [AO3](https://archiveofourown.org/) for the purpose of that comparison. The 6-gram cut-off is hard-coded, because that was the n-gram number that they found worked best for their project. And while the code includes some tokenization (e.g. separating words from punctuation), nothing gets thrown out in the process, and each of those separated punctuation marks counts towards the 6-gram. One occurrence of **“Claudia’s** gives you 4 things: \n",

        "We've used Jupyter notebooks in [Multilingual Mystery #2: Beware, Lee and Quinn](dscm2), but if you haven't come across them before, they're a way of writing code (most often Python, but also R and other languages) where the code can be inter-mixed with human-readable text. You read the text blocks, you run the code blocks. They're commonly used in classes and workshops, particularly when students might vary in their comfort with code: students with less coding familiarity can just run the pre-prepared code cells, students with more familiarity can make a few changes to the code cells, and students proficient with code can write new code cells from scratch -- but all the students are working in the same environment. Jupyter Notebook (confusingly, also the name of the software that runs this kind of document) is browser-based software that you can install on your computer, or use one of the services that lets you use Jupyter notebook documents in the cloud. I've written up a [much longer introduction to Jupyter notebooks over on Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/jupyter-notebooks) if you'd like to learn more. Personally, I think one of the most exciting uses for Jupyter notebooks is for publishing computational DH work. Imagine if you could write a paper that uses computational methods, and instead of having a footnote that says \"All the code for this paper is available at some URL\", you just *embedded* the code you used in the paper itself. Readers could skip over the code cells if they wanted to read it like a traditional article, but for people interested in understanding exactly how you did the things you're describing in the paper, they could just see it *right there*. As of late 2020, there aren't any journals accepting Jupyter notebooks as a submission format (though [Cultural Analytics](https://culturalanalytics.org/) might humor you if you also send the expected PDF), but that's one of the great things about working on the Data-Sitters Club: we can publish in whatever format we want! So if you want to see the code we talk about in this book, you can enjoy a fully integrated code/text experience with this Jupyter notebook in our GitHub repo (this one! that you're reading right now!)... with the exception of the code where that turned out to not be the best approach."

Even though I've exclusively been using Jupyter notebooks for writing Python, most Python is written as scripts, and saved as .py files.

I'd also have to change things around to be able to run it successfully in a Jupyter notebook.

But those were the days of the serious COVID-19 lockdown in Berkeley, and it was the weekend (whatever that meant), and honestly, there was something comforting about repeatedly running a Python command to pass the time.  Again and again I entered `python ao3.py search fanworks scripts/00n_some_bsc_book_title_here.txt`, in order to compare one book after another to the whole corpus. Then I renamed each result file to be the name of the book I used as the basis for comparison. As the files piled up, I marveled at the different file sizes. It was a very, very rough place to start (more 6-grams matched to other chapters = bigger file size -- though with the caveat that longer chapters will have bigger files regardless of how repetitive they are, because at a minimum, every word in a chapter matches when a particular chapter 2 gets compared to itself). Honestly, it was one of the most exciting things I’d done in a while. (Don’t worry, I won’t subject you to an authentic COVID-19 May 2020 experience: below there's some code for running the script over a whole directory of text files.)\n"

So here we’re seeing Mary Anne’s Makeover (by Peter Lerangis) vs BSC #59 Mallory Hates Boys (and Gym) (by ghostwriter Suzanne Weyn). Columns B and E are the indices for the words that are being matched-- i.e. where those words occur within the text file. Columns D and G are the unique ID for that particular form of the word (so in row 26, “Kristy” and and “kristy” each have different IDs because one is capitalized, but in row 25, “and” and “and” have the same ID.) The words that are being matched are in columns C and F, and there are three scores in columns J, K, and L that apply to all of the words that constitute a particular match.)\n",

        "This is definitely pulling out some of the tropes. Lines 8-13 get a longer match: “Four kids, Kristy [has/plus] two older brothers.” Lines 15-20 get “Can you imagine?” -- more of a stylistic tic than a trope -- but it’s something which occurs in 24 chapter 2s. Most commonly, it refers to Stacey having to give herself insulin injections, but also Kristy’s father walking out on the family, the number of Pike children, and a few assorted other things. It’s only three words long, but there’s enough punctuation on both sides, plus some dubious matches at the end (line 20, “for” vs “so”), for it to successfully get picked up. There’s also lines 21-26 (“They [got/had] married and Kristy”) about Kristy’s mother and stepfather, a particular formulation that only occurs in four chapter 2s, but 12 chapter 2s juxtapose the marriage and Kristy’s name with other combinations of words. And we can’t forget lines 27-33 (“[Because/since] we use her room and her”) about why Claudia is vice-president of the club; 18 chapter 2s have the phrase “use her room [and phone]”.\n"

        "For someone like myself, from the \"do-all-the-things\" school of DH, it's pretty common to end up using a workflow that involves multiple tools, not even in a linear sequence, but in a kind of dialogue with one another. The output of one tool (Scott's text comparison) leaves me wondering how often certain phrases occur, so I follow up in [AntConc](https://datasittersclub.github.io/site/dsc4/). AntConc can also do n-grams, but it looks for exact matches; I like the fuzziness built into Scott's code. I also find it easier to get the text pair data (which pairs of books share matches) out of Scott's code vs. AntConc. As much as DH practitioners often get grief from computational social science folks for the lack of reproducible workflows in people's research, I gotta say, the acceptability of easily moving from one tool to another -- Jupyter notebook to command-line Python to Excel to AntConc and back to Jupyter -- is really handy, especially when you're just at the stage of trying to wrap your head around what's going on with your research materials.\n",

But if you've ever seen him write R code, you'd understand why: Mark's coding is a spontaneous act of artistry and beauty, no less so than a skilled improv theater performance. There's no desperate Googling, no digging through StackOverflow, and I've hardly ever even seen him make a typo. Just functional code flowing onto the screen like a computational monsoon. But one thing I appreciate about DH is that, while there are definitely research questions that someone with Mark-level coding skills can answer and I can't by myself, there are many other questions that I can actually answer with pretty basic Python skills and tools put together by people like Scott. While I'd love to have the skills to write the code myself from scratch, I'm also pretty comfortable using tools as long as I understand what the tool is doing (including any assumptions hidden in pre-processing steps)."

        "\n",
        "As I dug further into my spreadsheet, I came across some “matches” that… didn’t really work. Like lines 1656-1661: “I didn’t want to” vs “I didn’t tell you”. Yeah, no. And even 1662-1668: “[need/trying] to line up a sitter”. It occurs in 8 chapter 2s, but it feels less like a trope and more like colloquial English about babysitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is where the last three columns -- J, K, and L -- come in. Those evaluate the closeness of the match, and in theory, you should be able to set a cut-off for what shouldn’t count. Column J is “best match distance”. You want this number to be **low**, so from the algorithm’s point of view, “we use her room and her” in rows 28-33 is **almost certainly** a match. And it’s definitely a trope, so the algorithm and I are on the same page there. Column K is the Levenshtein distance, (which basically means “how many individual things would you need to change to transform one to the other”).  And the combined distance tries to… well, combine the two approaches.\n",
        "\n",
        "The “match” that I rate as a failure as a human reader, “I didn’t want to / I didn’t tell you”, has a match distance of .08 -- so should that be the cutoff? Except one of the tropes, “Four kids, Kristy [has/plus] two older brothers.” has a distance of .09. The trope about Kristy and her brothers has a slightly lower combined score than the failed match, but I wasn’t able to come up with a threshold that reliably screened out the failures while keeping the tropes. So I didn’t -- I kept everything. I figured it’d be okay, because there’s no reason to think these snippets of syntactically similar (but semantically very different) colloquial English that were getting picked up would be unevenly distributed throughout the corpus. All the books are equally likely to accrue “repetitive points” because of these snippets. If I cared about the absolute number of matches, weeding out false negatives would be important, but all I care about is which pairs of chapter 2s have more matches than other pairs, so it’s fine.\n"

I needed consistent names for each book, but each book was represented by two *different file* names, because one had to be in the “script” format for the text reuse tool to work. Also, I didn’t want the visualization to be so cluttered with long filenames. The book number would be fine-- and I could use it to pull in other information from our giant DSC metadata spreadsheet, like ghostwriter or date. (Curious how we made the DSC metadata spreadsheet?

What’s up with books 6, 7, and 8 (written in sequence in 1987) being so closely linked to mystery 28, written in 1997? Personally, I find it easy to get pulled too far into the world of network analysis once I’ve imported my data, losing sight of what it means for some nodes to be connected and others not. To meaningfully interpret your network, though, you can’t forget about this. What does it mean that chapter 2 of BSC #7: *Claudia and Mean Janine* is connected to many other chapter 2s? It means that the same text repetitions (at least some of which are probably tropes) appear in all those books. With *Boy-Crazy Stacey* and *Abby and the Mystery Baby*, respectively, it shares tropes that are different tropes than those shared with other books -- otherwise *Boy-Crazy Stacey* and *Abby and the Mystery Baby* would be connected to those other books, too. This is a moment where it’s really helpful to recall previous decisions you made in the workflow. Remember how we didn’t set a cut-off value in Scott’s text comparison output, in order to not lose tropes, with the consequence of some colloquial English phrases being included? If you wanted to make any sort of claim about the significance of *Claudia and Mean Janine* being the only connection for *Boy-Crazy Stacey*, this is the moment where you’d need to open up the spreadsheets for those books and look at what those matches are. Maybe BSC #6, #8, and Mystery #28 are ones where chapter 3 has all the intro prose, but they happened to have 10 “colloquial English” matches with BSC #7.

Just because there’s a statistical method called ‘innovation’ (which measures how much word usage changes over the course of a document from beginning to end), that doesn’t mean that it’s a statistical method that can measure literary innovation. To bridge that gap, you have to either adapt the method or adapt your definition of literary innovation,” cautioned Mark. “Now, your logic goes: people talk about chapter two being similar across books, similarity can imply a kind of repetition, repetition can manifest in a re-use  of specific language between texts, Scott’s method measures re-use of language, therefore you’re thinking you can use Scott’s method to measure similarity. But there is a LOT of translation going on there: similarity → repetition → re-use → common 6-grams. Were someone to do this unthinkingly, they could very easily miss this chain of reasoning and think that common 6-grams is measuring textual similarity.” \n",

When people hear ‘are similar to’ they don’t necessarily jump immediately (or ever) to, uses the same phrases – this is why first thinking through what you mean by ‘similar’ and THEN moving to choosing a method that can try to represent that is a crucial step.” He paused for a moment. “Not everyone would agree, though.

If you ask someone how similar two books, or two series are, the metrics they use are probably going to depend on the pair you present them with. How similar are BSC #10: *Logan Likes Mary Anne* and Charlotte Brontë's *Jane Eyre*? Well, they both involve the first-person narration of a teenage female protagonist, a romance subplot, and childcare-based employment -- but probably no one would think of these books as being all that similar, due to the difference in setting and vastly different levels of cultural prestige, if nothing else. What about Logan Likes Mary Anne compared to Sweet Valley High #5: *All Night Long*, where teenage bad-twin Jessica starts dating a college boy, stays out all night with him, and asks good-twin Liz to take a test for her? The setting is a lot more similar (1980's affluent suburban United States) and there's also a romance subplot, but SVH #5 is written in the third person, the series is for a much edgier audience than the Baby-Sitters Club, and the character of Mary Anne is probably more similar to Jane Eyre than Jessica Wakefield.\n",

Let me assure you: they cannot.\n",

And in some cases, they've found ways of measuring proxies for those things, that seem to basically work out. But those things are too abstract for a computer to measure directly. What a computer can measure is words. There's tons of different ways that computers can measure words. Sometimes we use computers to just count words, for word frequencies. Computers can look at which words tend to occur together through something like n-grams, or more complex methods for looking at word distributions, like topic modeling or word vectors. We'll get to those in a future DSC book. With languages that have good natural-language processing tools (and English is the best-supported language in the world), you can look at words in a slightly more abstract way by annotating part-of-speech information for each word, or annotating different syntactic structures. Then you can do measurements based on those: counting all the nouns in a text, looking at which verbs are most common across different texts, counting the frequency of dependent clauses.\n",

        "It turns out that looking at the distributions of the highest-frequency words in a text is a way to identify different authors. So if you're interested more in what the text is about, you need to look at a large number of words (a few thousand), or just look at the most common nouns to avoid interference from what's known as an \"author signal\". The choice of what words you're counting -- and how many -- is different than the choice of what algorithm you use to do the measuring. But it's at least as important, if not more so."

        "1.  Choose what you want to measure. If you're not sure, you can start with something like the top 1,000 words, because that doesn't require you to do any computationally-intensive pre-processing, like creating a derivative text that only includes the nouns-- you can work directly with the plain-text files that make up your corpus. Whatever number you choose as the cutoff, though, needs to be sensitive to the length of the texts in your corpus. If your shortest text is 1,000 words and your longest text is 10,000 words, do you really want a cutoff that will get every single word (with room to spare once you consider duplicate words) in one of your texts? Also, you may want to be more picky than just using the top 1,000 words, depending on the corpus. With the Baby-Sitters Club corpus, character names are really important, and most characters recur throughout the series. But if you're working with a huge corpus of 20th-century sci-fi, you might want to throw out proper names altogether, so that the fact that each book has different characters doesn't obscure significant similarities in, for instance, what those characters are doing. Similarly, all the Baby-Sitters Club books are written in the first person, from one character's perspective (or multiple characters' perspective, in the case of the Super Specials). If you're working with multiple series, or books that aren't in a series, you could reasonably choose to throw out personal pronouns so that the difference between \"I\" and \"she/he\" doesn't mess with your similarity calculations. \n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Normalize your word counts. (I didn't know about this at first, and didn't do it the first time I compared the texts, but it turns out to be really important. More on that adventure shortly!)  While some text comparison algorithms are more sensitive to differences in text length, you can't get around the fact that two occurrences of a word are more significant in a 100-word text than a 1,000-word text, let alone a 10,000-word text. To account for this, you can go from word counts to word frequencies, dividing the number of occurrences of a given word by the total number of words. (There's code for this in the Jupyter notebook, you don't have to do it by hand.)\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Choose a method of comparing your texts. Euclidean distance and cosine distance have advantages and disadvantages that I get into below, and TF-IDF combined with one of those distance measures gives you a slightly different view onto your text than if you just use word counts, even normalized.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  \"Vectorize\" your text. This is the process that, basically, \"maps\" each text to a set of coordinates. It's easy to imagine this taking the form of X, Y coordinates for each text, but don't forget what we're actually counting: frequencies of the top 1,000 words. There's a count-value for each one of those 1,000 words, so what's being calculated are coordinates for each text in 1000-dimensional space. It's kinda freaky to try to imagine, but easier if you think of it less as 1000-dimensional space, and more as a large spreadsheet with 1,000 rows (one for each word), and value for each row (the word count or frequency for each). Each of those row-values is the coordinates of the text in that one dimension. You could just pick two words, and declare them your X and Y coordinates -- and maybe that might even be interesting, depending on the words you pick! (Like, here's a chart of the frequency of Kristy to Claudia.) But in almost all cases, we want the coordinates for the text-point to incorporate data from all the words, not just two. And that's how we end up in 1000-dimensional space. The good news is that you don't have to imagine it: we're not trying to visualize it yet, we're just telling Python to create a point in 1000-dimensional space for each text.\n",

You can compare that number to numbers you get back for other pairs of texts, but the best way to make sure that you're getting sensible results is to be familiar with the texts in question, and draw upon that knowledge for your evaluation.

You can do things like strip out, for instance, words that occur in at least 70% of the text by adding `max_df = .7` after `max_features`. That's the default suggested by [John R.

Sometimes you do that without checking in with yourself about whether you actually <em>want</em> it to do everything that it's doing. Maybe you tell yourself you'll just run it once as-is, then go back and consider its parameters more carefully... but instead you get excited and distracted and don't go back and fix that before you reference back to that code for subsequent analyses and... well, for this particular corpus, dropping words that occur in at least 70% of the texts isn't a great idea, because you lose things like frequency of character names, which are <em>actually pretty important</em> in the Baby-Sitters Club. And the result is that your texts end up looking more-different than they should, because you've dropped a lot of what they have in common: the same core set of characters.\n",

Instead of trying to measure the **distance** between two points (which can be thrown off due to issues of magnitude, when one point represents a text that’s much longer than the other), it measures the cosine of the angle between them and calls it *similarity*. You may have also filed “cosine” away under “high school math I hoped to never see again”, but don’t panic! As trigonometry starts to flood back at you, you might find yourself wondering, “Why cosine similarity, and not any of its little friends, like sine or tangent?” After all, wouldn’t it be fun to burst into the chorus of Ace of Base’s “I Saw the Sine” whenever you worked out the text similarity?\n",

If the angle is 90 degrees, which is as far as you can get while staying in all-positive numbers (we don’t have any negative word counts), then there’s a huge difference. Cos(0) = 1, and cos(90) = 0, so with cosine similarity, you want **larger** numbers for more similarity. Which is the opposite of Euclidean distance, where you want **smaller** numbers for more similarity (because using that measure, 0 means “there’s no distance between these things and they are the same”). I’ve screwed this up more than once, getting excited about large numbers when using an algorithm where you want smaller numbers, and vice versa. Always double-check the scale you’re using and what counts as “similar” if you’re not sure. Or, as you might find in a Choose Your Own Adventure book: *“The tweet was written, delayed only by the search for the perfect celebratory emoji to decorate its conclusion, when a small voice echoes in the back of your head. ‘Should these be large numbers? What algorithm did you use?’ You pause and think for a moment… then sigh, delete the tweet, and return to your code to start over. The end.”*"

The Euclidean distance score can be more nuanced, but this is a situation where nuance is a bad thing. I’m not doing this particular analysis to find precisely how different the texts are from each other -- which is a good thing, because I know the variable length is a distorting factor that would prevent me from getting to that perfect number anyway.

When you use too many dimensions, especially when you use word frequencies, there are a lot of 0s, and these are overweighted by Euclidean distance so that similar texts of very different lengths look much more different than they should – because the longer text has a lot of words that the shorter text doesn’t have (and the reverse is not as true – the shorter text has far fewer words that the longer text doesn’t have). So, when you compare a novel to a short story (or a LONG novel to a normal novel), this becomes a real problem. Cosine is still probably a better metric for the kind of work that you are doing, but here too it is crucial to scale/normalize your counts – otherwise size just keeps becoming a factor.

People were concerned about normalization, and I couldn't figure out how to make it work with scikit-learn, and it made me wonder if it was the right package for the job. But here's how normalization works with the TF-IDF vectorizer: if you set it to 'l1', you get relative frequencies. What it does is make the sum (of absolute values, but we don't have any negative word counts here) of all the features (word counts) add up to 1.  Now, l2 is the standard machine learning normalization for text analysis. L2 normalization makes it so that the sum of the *squares* of features is equal to 1. This better accounts for outliers. It basically uses the <a href=\"https://limitlessdatascience.wordpress.com/2019/04/16/normalisation-l1-l2-norms/\">Pythagorean theorem to normalize the vectors</a>.\"</p>\n",

For each text, what are the words that set it apart from all the other texts you’re comparing against? To calculate TF-IDF, you don’t have to imagine 1000-dimensional space or anything like that. Term frequency is just how often the word occurs, divided by the total number of words in the text. Inverse document frequency is a way to reduce the importance of words that are high-frequency everywhere (like “the”) in order to surface the words that are high frequency in a particular text because they’re important. You calculate it using another concept from high school math: your old pal logarithm. The inverse document frequency for a word is: log_e(Total number of documents / Number of documents with term t in it)."

But the output we get from TF-IDF is a list of words and numerical values, which isn’t something we can use to visualize a comparison of the texts, the way we could with the output of the vectorizer we used to plot points in 1000-dimensional space. We *can* use the TF-IDF calculations for each word in our vectorizer instead of simple word counts, which will generate a different set of points for each text, and from there we can use Euclidean or Cosine distance. But before we go there, let’s take a look at what we get out of the TF-IDF calculation, using our full-text corpus (not just the chapter 2s).\n",

Lowell Johnston is only mentioned twice in *The Truth About Stacey*, so it’s still not going to get a high TF-IDF score in that book (it comes in #103 with a score of 10.64). But in *Keep Out, Claudia!*, Lowell appears a lot, and that number isn’t scaled down much at all because it only occurs in two books. So it ends up getting the highest TF-IDF score for that book, 707.82. This is a large score, more similar to characters in “very special episodes” who appear in just one book, like Whitney (the girl with Down’s Syndrome who Dawn babysits in BSC #77: *Dawn and Whitney, Friends Forever*).\n",

(If anything, we’re getting fewer high-scoring character names than you’d expect in most fiction. The major characters occur frequently enough that they get weighted down, like words like “the” and “is”.) "

Imagine you’ve never read a Baby-Sitters Club book (perhaps that’s not hard for some of you!) and someone hands you a corpus of 250 text files and tells you to go find something interesting about them. Without having to read them at all, you could discover the things we’ve talked about here. The California Diaries sub-series is really different! There’s something weird going on with these super-repetitive chapter 2s! \n",

(With something like Twitter data, there probably isn’t anyone who’s read every tweet in the corpus you’ve collected, but if your data is collected based on a hashtag, you might be able to find someone to talk to from the community that uses that hashtag.) In the case of the Baby-Sitters Club, anyone who’s read the books can tell you that the chapter 2 phenomenon is well-known. So what new insights are these distance metrics providing?\n",

As much as I love trying new methods to see what will happen, I should’ve seen where this was going and been more confident in the choice I’d made to use Scott’s 6-gram tool as the way to tackle the chapter 2 question. *That* approach got us something new, surfacing (albeit with some noise) a set of tropes repeated through the corpus, and showing that the highest amounts of repetition tend to happen among the works of a single ghostwriter. It’s not a shock, but it feels like some kind of contribution -- and more of a contribution than just quantifying how much more similar the chapter 2s are compared to the other chapters.\n",

And do these features change over time or between different groups of books? Also, you could move the same way to visualizations: what about a network where each chapter 2 is a node, and you connect it to the most similar other chapter 2’s based on a similarity threshold? You could easily wind up showing again that this varies by ghostwriter. Or you could find something else, which would be super cool. I’d be most interested in the chapter 2’s that were definitely chapter 2’s (that is, they took part in the same convention, not where chapter 3 is actually “chapter 2”), but whose language was LEAST similar – what are they doing differently?”\n",

Your brain is whirring away at trying to piece together the code for how to tackle this one. You know it’ll fuel your insomnia, but for this moment, you don’t mind.
